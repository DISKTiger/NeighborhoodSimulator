# NeighborhoodSimulator

Neighboorhood Simulator is, like the name says, a simulator of a neighboorhood; an apartment building. 
So before the user starts a new game, we first populate the "world" with a big number of random people, and time jump until the first generation (the one that is born without family) is dead. 
Then, we populate the neighboorhood by choosing 10 (or whichever number of households the building has) random unrelated adults, and move them and their families to each apartment.
So now the game can begin for the user. We start by presenting him/her the neighboorhood (who lives in each household and their basic info) and then the user can time jump at any moment so that he/she can see the neighbors growing up and their life developments year by year.

Pending:
* Pets for each household (statistical chance, statistical number and type of pets).
* Disabilities such as autistic kids (statistical chance)
* Empty household replacement(?)
* Empty household except for underage child.
* Neighborhood friendship system
* Gay adoption
* Throuple biological / adopted children (?)
* Consang biological / adopted children (?)
* Consequences of coming out if conservative family (statistical chance for being thrown out / moving out / suicide)
* Intermittent employment (statistical chance)
* Personality and hobbies for neighbors
* Setting option for users: realistic statistics and custom statistics (user can modify for example the statistical chance for male/female to a 20/70 ratio)
* Upper class / Middle class / Lower class for each household family
* Once young adult: university vs working vs not doing anything (statistical chance, and also may depend on class)

Bugs:
Too many to list... Project needs bug cheking, error handling / debugging ASAP. Also, it's currently SLOW as fuck.

Contribution:
Please anyone feel free to create a branch and contribute. Too much work for one person alone! :)
